<h3>
    People have demonstrated three different ways of hacking the self-driving car.

            The fear is that as the technology for making the car becomes more successful and is more widely used, people will begin to use this technology to hack the cars. And the crazy thing is, the media is barely mentioning it. The advent of self-driving cars will also cause a lot of unemployment, and such people might retaliate by hacking or sabotage. People have been demonstrating how easy it is to confuse the cars.

        <h3>
            Hacking the Autopilot
        </h3>
        <p>
            Researchers from Chinaâ€™s Zhejiang University, University of South Carolina, and the Chinese security company Qihoo 360 were able to disable some of the sensors on a Tesla Model S (with Autopilot, which is the system of camera sensors that Tesla uses), confusing its GPS.

        <h3>
            Hacking the AI
        </h3>
        <p>
            Another thing people were able to do was confuse the AI. Researchers at CMU were able to confuse state of the art facial recognition technology just by wearing glasses with a cool design on the lenses. This was to show that unauthorized people who wanted to hack and unlock the cars would easily be able to.

        <h3>
            Confusing the Recognition
        </h3>
        <p>
            Another way they were able to confuse the car was on the road itself. Yoshi Kohno, a researcher at UW, described an algorithm for attacking the recognition system the car uses that involved sticking images on road signs. These images, which were placed on a normal stop sign, confused the system into thinking it was a Speed Limit 45 sign. These examples show that even the smallest things can confuse autonomous cars.
