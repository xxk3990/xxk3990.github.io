        <h3> Snow </h3>
        <p>
            When driving in snow, the road can often be completely covered. Snow-covered roads are invisible to the Lidar (using light from laser beams) system the car uses to sense other things on the road.
        </p>
        <h3>Rain</h3>
        <p>
            Rain can be picked up by the Lidar, but the car will pick that up as an object nearby. The cars need to be programmed to see through the rain and focus on their surroundings.
        </p>
            <h3> Bridges </h3>
            <p>
           Self-driving cars have had problems going over bridges. Since they use their surroundings to locate themselves, and since most bridges aren't near any major structures, the car has had trouble picking up where it is. 
            </p>
        <h3>Road Markings</h3>
        <p>
       Some roads don’t have clear lane markings, which again will cause problems for the lidar and might stop the car from being able to switch lanes easily.
        </p>
            <h3>Cities</h3>
            <p>
             On a highway or in a rural town, there is a lot less to worry about. In a city, however, there are a lot of people, there are a lot of bumps in the road, potholes, and there are a lot of cars. The problems don’t end there. People who drive into cities from rural areas and use the GPS a lot can have problems getting signal due to the tall buildings. Will the car be able to distinguish between car lanes, bus lanes, and bike lanes? Bike lanes have a symbol for a bike on them to let you know that it's a bike lane. Will the car be able to read that?   
            </p>
            <h3>
            Communication between drivers
            </h3>
            <p>
            The car cannot communicate the way humans can. You’re taught in driver’s ed what to do in certain situations and who gets the right of way when, but the car might not understand this. Usually humans signal to other drivers to inform them of what they are trying to do, and these happen usually to avoid accidents. How will the self-driving car coming towards your self-driving car know what you want to do?
